title: Colorado Historic Preservation Tax Credit
description: "Federal and state tax laws provide tax incentives for historic preservation projects that follow the Secretary of the Interior's Standards for Rehabilitation.  These credits allow taxpayers to reduce, on a dollar-for-dollar basis, the amount of income tax they owe to the government.  The amount of credit that can be obtained is calculated as a percentage of the overall rehabilitation costs associated with the project-\n-- A 10% federal tax credit for the rehabilitation of older, non-historic commercial properties\n-- A 20% federal tax credit for the rehabilitation of certified historic buildings used for income-producing purposes\n-- A 20% state tax credit for the rehabilitation of historic, owner-occupied residences\n-- A 20% -30% state tax credit for the rehabilitation of historic buildings used for income-producing purposes\nApplicants are urged to contact History Coloradoâ€™s Office of Archaeology and Historic Preservation (OAHP) as early as possible to ensure that all requirements are met when applying for these programs.  Our staff can provide advice to owners, developers, and architects concerning appropriate preservation and rehabilitation measures.  In some cases, our staff will review applications for tax credits and make official recommendations for approval.\n\nFor more information, visit: \nhttp://www.historycolorado.org/grants/preservation-tax-credits"

Federal and state tax laws provide tax incentives for historic preservation projects that follow the Secretary of the Interior's Standards for Rehabilitation.  The federal government offers a 20% investment tax credit for the approved rehabilitation of certified historic buildings used for income-producing purposes as well as a 10% credit for certain other older buildings.

The state offers a similar 20% state income tax credit based on $5,000 or more of approved preservation work on designated properties.  Applicants are urged to contact Office of Archaeology and Historic Preservation (OAHP) staff as early as possible when considering an application for either federal or state tax credits.  OAHP provides advice to property owners, developers, and architects concerning appropriate preservation and rehabilitation measures.  OAHP staff review applications for tax incentives and make recommendations for approval.
