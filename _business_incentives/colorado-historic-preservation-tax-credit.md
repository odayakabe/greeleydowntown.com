Federal and state tax laws provide tax incentives for historic preservation projects that follow the Secretary of the Interior's Standards for Rehabilitation.  The federal government offers a 20% investment tax credit for the approved rehabilitation of certified historic buildings used for income-producing purposes as well as a 10% credit for certain other older buildings.

The state offers a similar 20% state income tax credit based on $5,000 or more of approved preservation work on designated properties.  Applicants are urged to contact Office of Archaeology and Historic Preservation (OAHP) staff as early as possible when considering an application for either federal or state tax credits.  OAHP provides advice to property owners, developers, and architects concerning appropriate preservation and rehabilitation measures.  OAHP staff review applications for tax incentives and make recommendations for approval.
