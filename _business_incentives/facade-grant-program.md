The program offers grants to businesses and/or property owners in the Downtown Development Authority Tax Increment Funding (DDA TIF) district to renovate and rehabilitate building facades.  This program is offered by the DDA to leverage private improvements that contribute to the overall aesthetics of the district while making revitalization efforts affordable, creative and community-based.

The program offers two grant options for applicants based on the needs of the business and/or property owner:

1. Façade Matching Grant Program: The DDA will provide a 1/1 matching grant for the cost of eligible façade improvements. The matching grant shall not exceed $7,500.
2. Façade Incentive Program: The DDA will provide an incentive of up to 10% of the total project redevelopment cost (interior improvement costs + façade improvement costs), up to 100% of the cost of eligible façade improvements.


This grant will be offered on an ongoing basis as funding permits.  The award amount is based on available funds, applicants, and other variables. The grant will be allocated to façade, signage, awning, and other eligible projects, and is available to tenants, business, and property owners.  Larger grants may be considered at the discretion of the DDA Board only.
