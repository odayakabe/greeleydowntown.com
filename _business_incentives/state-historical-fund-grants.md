History Colorado has two areas that provide grants for archaeology and historic preservation projects. The Office of Archaeology and Historic Preservation administers the U.S. Department of Interior's Historic Preservation Fund Program in cooperation with the U.S. Department of the Interior, National Park Service.

The State Historical Fund is a statewide grants program that was created by the 1990 constitutional amendment allowing limited gaming in the towns of Cripple Creek, Central City, and Black Hawk.  The amendment directs that a portion of the gaming tax revenues be used for historic preservation throughout the state.
