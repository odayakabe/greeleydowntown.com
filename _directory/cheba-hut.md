We are nestled on the corner of 8th Avenue and 17th Street northeast of campus. We sport the largest deck on the block and offer cold Micro brews on its vast expanse. We opened just prior to 420 in 2009 and are looking forward to serving Greeley for years to come!Â Each Cheba Hut offers unique, one of a kind sandwiches, signature salads and incredible munchies you just can't find anywhere else.
