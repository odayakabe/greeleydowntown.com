Open 10 till 10 Mon thru Sat. Purchase and drink loose leaf tea, snacks, teaware, and speciality drinks. Enjoy live acoustic music. Free wifi!, Giving one of the world's oldest and most popular beverages a new voice in Weld County, Cranford Cove Tea Tavern introduces it's take on the tea house with its downtown Greeley location, which opened to the public in 2013 at 823 10th Street. The concept's name is derived from the owner's love of the sea, the historic Greeley neighborhood of Cranford, and the fact that the establishment is a tea house, cafe, acoustic music venue, AND a full bar., With almost 60 varieties of loose leaf, owners Aaron and Sarah Wooten focus on a unique and thoughtful selection of teas spanning the globe, ranging from loose cured leaf varieties, iced teas on tap, and fruit and herb-infused custom creations. Tea is served in the tavern and sold retail by the ounce for steeping at home. We also sell tea cups, pots, and other teaware. Cranford Cove offers various tea services for individuals or groups, complete with paninis, scones and pastries., The design for Cranford Cove can best be described as Art Deco meets plantation, where old-school tea has a modern edge. The space has high ceilings and features multiple seating options from table seating to bar seating. In the summer we provide a few tables for outdoor patio seating., â€œThis is definitely not your grandmotherâ€™s tea house â€“ after water, tea is the most widely consumed beverage in the world and we intend to present the best quality and most interesting single varietals and blends available,â€ explained Aaron Wooten. â€œWe also serve unique tea-infused cocktails, local crafted beer, and have an ever-expanding wine list designed to fit any palate. We also support the local music scene,â€ he continued, â€œon almost any night you can experience local jazz from the world-renowed UNC program, local singer-songwriters, blues or salsa from artists up and done the front range playing live in the tea tavern.â€, With almost 60 varieties, Cranford Cove offers an extensive selection of teas meant to deliver a rich and varied experience. We also serve a waffle brunch, lunch, and a variety of snacks and tea pastries.
