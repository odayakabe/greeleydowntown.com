Do you think of yourself as spiritual, but not religious? Would you like to learn about the truths that are found in every great spiritual teaching? Longing to be part of a loving community that plays together as well as it prays together? Creative Center for Spiritual Living may be the home you have been looking for. We believe in a world that works for everyone. We subscribe to New Thought teachings, believing that we are united as one, connected to one another as we are connected to the One which we call God, or Spirit, or Universal Energy, or any other name that works for you. We know that all paths lead to God and we respect and honor each person's path. All are welcome here. If you've read Ekhart Tolle, The Secret, Marianne Williamson, Debbie Ford, the Bible, the Torah, the Course in Miracles, the Bagahvad Gita, the Qur'an, any teaching of the Golden Rule of respect and love for one another, you will find our message simpatico. Rev. Barb gives thoughtful, insightful talks, the Music Team cooks up something great every week, our Youth Ministry is thriving and our community loves to socialize after service. We offer classes to enrich your spirituality, help you to grow personally and challenge your beliefs so that you may have an abundant, rewarding and fulfilling life. We have a Course in Miracles group that meets here every Saturday. Our regular service has been moved to Thursday nights at 7 pm for the summer (our "Happy Hour"). Sunday Spiritual Practice is every Sunday at 10 am. Please check the website for specifics and updates!
