The Eden Gallery was originally named for those new to art, or those who have stepped away, & want to step back into their creative side. The gallery features the artwork of Elaine Furister, whose experiences have inspired a selection of original watercolor paintings. The gallery offers a number of art classes & workshops.&nbsp;
