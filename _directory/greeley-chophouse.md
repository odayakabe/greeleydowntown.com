Located in the heart of downtown, the Greeley Chophouse brings fine dining to Northern Colorado. It is the perfect place to entertain business associates, or for a romantic date night. We also have a private room that is ideal for large parties and special events. No matter the occasion, a night out at the Chophouse is a trip back to the class, romance, and exquisite tastes of the 1930's. We serve the finest USDA prime meats paired with a perfectly balanced assortment of wines. We also offer a variety of fresh seafood dishes including the highest grade Ahi Tuna, Scallops, Halibut and Atlantic Salmon. Our menu is not limited to steak and seafood. Our chef caters to all tastes; offering dishes such as baked spaghetti squash ratatouille and a variety of pastas with homemade noodles. No matter how discerning the palate, the Greeley Chophouse is sure to satisfy.
