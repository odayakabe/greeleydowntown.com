Established in 1911, the Greeley Philharmonic Orchestra is the oldest orchestra in the Rocky Mountain Region. Under the baton of Music Director/Conductor, the GPO performs monthly concerts from September through April in the Monfort Concert Hall at the Union Colony Civic Center and other venues. Sixty-six professional musicians from throughout Colorado are joined by world-class guest artists to perform a variety of symphonic works. The GPO also presents music education programs in the schools.
