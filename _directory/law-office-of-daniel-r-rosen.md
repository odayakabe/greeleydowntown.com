Have you or a loved one been injured in an accident in Colorado due to someone else’s negligence? I’m Dan Rosen, and I’ve been handling personal injury cases for more than 30 years. I’ve settled over $100 million in accident and injury cases for my clients in Greeley and across Colorado, helping them receive fair compensation many types of personal injuries including auto accidents, pedestrian accidents, and slip-and-fall accidents. Contact an Experienced Colorado Personal Injury Attorney If you’ve been injured in an accident and are not seeking guidance from an experienced personal injury attorney, you may be giving the insurance company an opportunity to pay you less than your claim is worth. It takes a seasoned attorney to evaluate a personal injury claim, know what it’s worth, and get the insurance company to compensate you fairly.
