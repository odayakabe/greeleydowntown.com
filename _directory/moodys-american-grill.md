description: Moody's American Grill was built on a vision of home cooked, garden fresh dishes served in a relaxing atmosphere. We wanted to provide guests hearty tastes from across America, with the highest quality ingredients, simply prepared, at accessible prices. Moody's hometown concept resonates throughout the menu and into the friendly staff, creating a restaurant with big flavors and a small-town feel. Our signature burgers are made with all-natural, certified Angus beef, that travels only 18 miles from the farm to our grill. Beyond our burgers, Moody's eclectic menu includes the best seafood, the freshest vegetables and the most righteous ribs., , Moody's encompasses everything you should expect from your neighborhood grill. We offer a full-bar, a great outdoor patio and relaxed seating around our pot-belly stove. At Moody's, you'll find a great place to meet friends, enjoy a cold pint and suppress your cravings for a home-cooked meal. Make sure to check-out Moody's American Grill the next time you're in Downtown Greeley.
