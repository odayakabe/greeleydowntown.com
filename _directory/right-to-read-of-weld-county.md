Our Mission: To Provide affordable literacy, communication, and cultural orientation instruction for adults. Right to Read, Weld County is a non-profit organization dedicated to fighting illiteracy and poverty in the Weld County area. Our mission is to provide adults in this area with the necessary education, cultural awareness, and job skills to be a fulfilled, self-reliant, contributing member of our community. We offer classes that range from basic ESL (Level 1) to GED (Level 6) as well as an EL Civics/Citizenship class. Additionally, we work closely with other non-profit organizations to ensure financial and social success for each individual student and their family.
