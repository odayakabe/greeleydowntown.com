The Original Roma Restaurant has been a UNC staple and Greeley favorite since it's opening in 1988. Roma is on the North East side of the UNC campus at 8th Ave and 16th Streets, and has received the Greeley Tribune's BEST PIZZA award since the award began in 2008. Roma loves families, college students, visitors, and locals, and has daily food and drink/beer specials. If you have not had a Caroli or a Bazooka, you are missing part of what makes Greeley wonderful.&nbsp;
