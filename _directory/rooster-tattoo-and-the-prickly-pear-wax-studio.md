Welcome to Rooster Tattoo! Here at the coop Our artists are passionate about what they do. We strive to help you create and personalize your tattoo, so you will not find any "flash racks" on any of our walls. As soon as you enter our shop you will feel comfortable and will not be treated like you do not belong. Our artists will take the time to talk with you without making you feel pressured into getting a tattoo. We want our clients to be sure about what they will be permanently placing on their bodies. We are definitely a one of a kind tattoo shop!
