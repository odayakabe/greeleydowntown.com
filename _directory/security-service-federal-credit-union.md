description: In 1956, Security Service Federal Credit Union opened its doors with eight members and $25 in deposits. The credit union was founded as a not-for-profit, member-owned financial cooperative to serve the fiscal needs of the members of the U.S. Air Force Security Service Command and their families. Since those humble beginnings, the credit union has expanded to include not only military members but a large and diverse number of members from companies, organizations and geographic areas throughout the southwestern United States in its field of membership. Security Service is the eighth largest credit union in the country, serving more than 900,000 members worldwide. There are now more than 2,600 ways to qualify for membership.
