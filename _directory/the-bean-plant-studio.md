The Bean Plant Studio is a working studio not a gallery in the traditional sense. It is open on First Night Friday's and for other special events. You can send an email or call on the phone to make an appointment to visit the studio, Susan, and see the art showing during that particular month.Â Susan is a multi-media artist who also likes to sing and write.
