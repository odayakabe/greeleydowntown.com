TRAINING DANCERSâ€¦ INSPIRING ARTISTS The Conservatory Dance Studio offers classes for all ages. Our studio is a safe and solid place to grow as a dancer and a person. Classes are conducted by encouraging, professional adults that are invested in their students. Come down and register for classes today! The Conservatory offers much more than a series of dance classes. Although the dance education that is given to the students is well rounded, technically challenging and thorough, our real job is to instill self confidence, empowerment, structure, discipline and inspiration. We want to be part of your parenting team by having your child's best interest and development as our top priority. We offer an education for a lifetime; dance and movement is our vehicle.
