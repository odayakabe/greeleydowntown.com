Tower 21 is a non-profit 501c3 with a vision and passion to help people change their lives. Every one of us has had bad things happen, sometimes by our own choices and sometimes by other people's choices. Regardless of what has happened to us, regardless of what we have done to ourselves, we need to know that life can be different. We are a community of people out to help those who have found themselves trapped in addiction or those who find themselves in the legal system. We can help because we have been there ourselves. We can not only help carry the load of your burden, but empower you to get out from underneath it. All of us have the ability to change. We can grow. We don't have to remain where we are. At Tower 21 we believe our past may describe our history, but it does not determine our future. Come let us help you discover a new life…to Experience More, Become More.
