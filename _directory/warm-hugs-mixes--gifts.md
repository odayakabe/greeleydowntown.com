A great destination for finding the uncommon gift! Family recipes converted into delicious food mixes and packaged into "the unexpected" for great gift giving. Mixes range from soups to sweets. All-natural ingredients and mixed by hand. Beside the great food mixes we make here in Greeley, we have also made room for other handmade Colorado products by area artisans…candles for dry skin, salsa, lavender products, soaps, pottery, toffee and more! Stop by for a visit and try some of our delicious samples.
