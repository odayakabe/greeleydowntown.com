Welcome and thank you for checking out Waypoints Faith Community. In 2003 a small group of us gathered together to ask the simply question of is this it? The church experiences we had were good, but there seemed to be something missing. It didn't seem complete. Is this what Jesus had in mind? Are people being changed by their encounter with Christ? For us sadly the answer was no. We were doing church, but not experiencing church. We then set out to ask another question. What would church look like if it was done differently? What does a different kind of biblical faith community look like? In October 2003, we launched our community that we call Waypoints we the simple premise of seek first His kingdom and His righteousness. What we have discover so far is the greatest adventure of our lives. We would love to have you come and join us Charting a Course Through Life Together.
