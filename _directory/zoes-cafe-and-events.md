Located in the heart of Downtown Greeley, Zoe's is a locally owned, non-profit coffeehouse & event center. In addition to serving a variety of snacks and baked goods, we proudly serve the ethically and relationally sourced coffees of Coffee Ambassadors and loose leaf teas from The Tea Spot. Centered on the themes of beauty and justice, we are passionate about engaging our community on every level. We love the arts! So, there is an emphasis on supporting local artists and musicians through our art gallery and live music venue; we also host a wide variety of groups and community events through the use and rental of our space. And while Zoe's serves as a resource for the under-resourced in our community, we also love the world, and hope to build meaningful relationships around the world with a simple cup of coffee., , Hours: Monday - Thursday: 9 am- midnight
