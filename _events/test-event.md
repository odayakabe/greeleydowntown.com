<div itemprop="name"><strong>Earth From Space Exhibit @ The Greeley History Museum</strong></div>
<div itemprop="description">Wednesday-Saturday from 10am-4:30pm Sunday from Noon-4:30pm The Smithsonian Institution in partnership with the U.S. Geological Survey has provided the Greeley History Museum with its traveling exhibition, Earth from Space. Located in the museum's West Gallery, the exhibit runs through December 31st and features beautifully detailed satellite images of the planet-from the swirling arms of a massive hurricane and the grid-like pattern of Kansas farmland to the triangular shadows cast by the Great Pyramids and the sinuous channels entering the Arctic Ocean. Earth from Space illustrates how satellite imagery is gathered and used to expand mankind's understanding of life on Earth. It also explores the remote-sensing technology used to gather the images and describes the individual satellites whose images are on display. Educators can access the exhibit's companion website, www.earthfromspace.si.edu, which contains additional images and information.</div>
