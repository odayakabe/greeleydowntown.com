Premier retail/office near the UNC campus available July 1

The Campus Pharmacy Building is the best of both retail environments — a beautiful, historic building with a new retail addition and completely modernized mechanical systems throughout. The attached original 1928 historic building is occupied with the popular Margie’s Coffee Shop, Farmer's Pantry Market, and Madison & Main art gallery (separate entrances), which provide excellent customer traffic.

The 2003 red brick addition on the north side is separate space, available for office or retail use. It features a high finish, expansive 14-ft.wood-beam ceiling,  interior exposed red brick walls, floor-to-ceiling display windows, and glass block windows in the back.
