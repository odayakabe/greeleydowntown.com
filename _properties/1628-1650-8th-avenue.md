This mixed-use parcel is located directly across from the University of Northern Colorado. Zoned Commercial High-Density, this property is open for a multitude of uses and redevelopment opportunities. Ideally, this site would be mixed-use with retail on the 1st floor and apartments on the stories above. Currently there are three mixed-use commercial buildings and one multi-family building that are producing over $74,000/year.

<br>The City of Greeley is currently allowing up to four stories, but there is a possibility that there could be additional vertical square footage. The City has been very easy to work with and would like to see a nice project built here.
