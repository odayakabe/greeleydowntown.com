Originally the home of Fezer’s Drugstore and more recently Nelson’s Office Supply, the 805 8th Street building represents a unique opportunity for todays entrepreneur to make history. The new store front facade mixes upscale image with historic character. The main floor is suited for prime retail; second floor would be best for creative space/office environment.
<br>Matching TI allowance to offset tenant cost for custom design will be negotiated based on tenant use, lease term, proposed design ideas, etc.
<br>Main floor and second floor users will have shared access to main floor ADA accessible restrooms.
