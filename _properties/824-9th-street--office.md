Don't miss this opportunity to take advantage of Prime Office Space in the heart of Downtown Greeley! It is truly the heart of the city and with an engaged DDA, supportive business community, there is no better time. Great location across the street from The Rio and the Court House. Executive Offices available.

Public parking available behind building.
