Popular in-building Margie’s Caf&eacute;, Madison & Main Art Gallery, and The Bar.Ber.Shop. men’s salon provide excellent customer traffic through separate entrances.

A prominent corner entrance at the busy intersection of 16th Street and 10th Avenue is a prime location directly adjacent to the UNC Central campus. Built in 1928, the original building’s entrances and window openings have been restored, affording an expansive window presence for any retailer or restaurant.

The interior finish has been lovingly restored with respect given to the original 14-foot tin ceiling. Retail space includes beautiful built-in wall shelves with rolling ladder. Caf&eacute; space includes spacious off-street patio with separate entrance.
