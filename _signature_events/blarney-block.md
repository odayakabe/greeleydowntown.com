title: Blarney on the Block
description: "Enjoy a St. Patrick's Day celebration with \"small-town\" family -friendly fun! The event starts at 2pm with Irish Step Dancing from the Moriarty School of Irish Dance. Then we'll have our annual \"1st National Bank Blarney Parade\" at 2:30. Everyone can join! On the 9th St plaza you'll enjoy the bagpipes and drums of the Caledonia Pipe and Drum Band again, followed by Irish music on the 9th Street Stage with \"Juice of the Barley\" and Go-Cup on 9th Street. There will be kid's activities, face painting, a photo booth with props, and MORE! Avoid the crazy crowds in other big cities and come to a celebration where the whole family can relax and have fun outside together."
