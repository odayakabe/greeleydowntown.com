### Syntax Spirits Distillery

625 3rd Street, Unit C

Syntax Spirits Distillery will feature the work of Zachary Thomas Heil. Heil is a painter, illustrator and cartoonist based out of the front range of Northern Colorado. His expressive work is a stream of consciousness that combines abstraction with representation, often using a mix of drawing and painting media. The emotive nature of his pictures comes from an interpretation of life experiences as well as a reflection on the internal dialogue that exits within all of us. His art has been shown (and sometimes created in front of live audiences) primarily in venues and publications around Colorado, where he also studied studio art at Colorado State University and has been involved in local programs for the visual arts.
