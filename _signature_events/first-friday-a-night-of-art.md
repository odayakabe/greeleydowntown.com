Many students also wanted to tackle how to adapt the school space to better help their learning and will be presenting projects on their design to address problems they identified in the learning space. The event is open house style, is open to the public and it gives the students a public sphere to talk about their learning.

### Madison & Main Gallery

927 16th Street

On First Friday, February 2nd the Madison and Main Gallery is open until 8pm and there will be an artist demonstration from 5:30-7pm by Laura McElfresh about Watercolor Batik. This is a process that involves layers of hot wax and watercolor paint applied to rice paper.&nbsp; Once the layers of paint and wax are applied, the paper is crumpled and a final coat of paint is applied which seeps into the cracks of wax on the paper. The wax is then melted off of the paper, revealing the painting beneath. This creates a distinctive look like no other and is a demonstration not to miss! The show “Power of Love” continues through February 23 and features nine guest artists. Their new work includes paintings in oil, acrylic, watercolor, and batik; photography, illustrations, and mixed media pieces; jewelry of all kinds; glasswork, pottery, and paper. The slate of guest artists for this show includes: Cris Conklin, Pete Davis, Francis Denning, Allie Haskins, Melanie Haskins, Greg Mayse, Laura McElfresh, Janet Sacks, and Linda Toukan. The Madison & Main Gallery is artist-owned. Gallery hours are 10am-6pm Monday through Friday and 10am-4pm Saturday. All items in the gallery are for sale.
