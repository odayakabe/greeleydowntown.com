### The Dragon’s Cache

Michael's own photographic journey turned toward Dance and Music performance, this collection spanning the past thirty-seven years, from Bruce Springsteen’s “Born in the USA” tour (1984) to a 2016 concert by Nikki Hill. Michael's work in dance covers his time photographing the University of Arizona and the University of Nebraska dance programs from 1987-2003. These opportunities showcase the expertise of gifted lighting designers, choreographers, as well as the dancers themselves. Michael tries to convey the magic of this art to express the essential power of Life, from film, silver-coated paper, and darkroom alchemy to the “zeroes and ones” of digital photography. He believes that this visual art form communicates and speaks in a unique language beyond what words alone can provide, in this medium's use of equipment, light, movement, texture, and the artist's creative instinct, to anticipate, create, generate, and share what we can in the time we have while we are alive. Refreshments will be served.
