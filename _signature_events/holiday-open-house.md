### Small Business Saturday, Holiday Open House, Parade and Park Lighting Ceremony

Celebrate Small Business Saturday and make it a downtown Greeley day November 28th. Over twenty-five downtown Greeley businesses are hosting a bingo Holiday Open House. Pick up your bingo card at a participating business, get it stamped by at least 13 of the participants as instructed and you can enter to win $1,000, $300 or $200 in prizes and gift cards. No purchase necessary.
