Bring all your little goblins, ghouls, pirates and princesses to downtown Greeley Friday, October 28th from 4-6pm. Dozens of downtown businesses in and around the core downtown area will have treats for the little ones.

Both the 8th and 9th street plazas will be closed to traffic for maximum safety, but many businesses outside the plazas will also be involved. There will also be games and activities like Pumpkin Cornhole, Candy Corn Bowling, and Pumpkin Decorating for the first 150 tots.

Treats will also be strategically placed around the plazas for the little ones to find if they have a keen eye!

Pick up your map on the corner by the Rio and let the treat hunt begin!
