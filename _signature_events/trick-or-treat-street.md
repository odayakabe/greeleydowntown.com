Bring all your little goblins, ghouls, pirates and princesses to downtown Greeley Friday, October 27th from 4-6pm. Dozens of downtown businesses in and around the core downtown area will have treats for the little ones.

Both the 8th and 9th street plazas will be closed to traffic for maximum safety, but many businesses outside the plazas will also be involved. There will also be games and activities like Pumpkin Cornhole,  Mask coloring, and Pumpkin Decorating for the first 150 tots.

New this year - a pet costume contest sponsored by **Bentley’s Pet Stuff**.  Winner get a year of pet food!

Other activities sponsored by **Stewart Family Dental**- 3400 W. 16th St in Greeley

and **Ameritech Construction**  - Ameritech Construction understands that choosing to improve your home is a big decision. We’d like to show you why we are the educated choice for replacement windows and doors.
