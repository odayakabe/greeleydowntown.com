A DDA is a special purpose district that is established by voters who live, own or lease property in a defined area. It is governed by a Board of Directors, and is intended to foster economic development and revitalization within a downtown area. Both residential and commercial portions of a city are important and necessary elements of its history, character and vitality.

With projects of all sizes, both commercial and residential, programs for non-profits and individuals, developers and businesses, the DDA approach has been widely successful in downtown areas across the country. Through the use of financial tools for new development, as well as, redevelopment, they are a catalyst for revitalization.

The goal of the Greeley Downtown Development Authority (DDA) is reflected in its Vision Statement:

“To create a thriving, urban neighborhood that is a vibrant place to live, work and play.”

A few of the DDA’s project and services for downtown include:

* Downtown business recruitment and retention projects
* Historic preservation
* Technical & architectural assistance
* Downtown beautification
* Architectural assistance for property owners
* Information about incentives for new businesses and property rehabilitation
* Special events such as Oktoberfest and Friday Fest


From entertainment venues to retail stores, professional services to residential spaces, the Greeley Downtown Development Authority is working to create a well-rounded, versatile, vibrant downtown.

In the summer of 2011, Progressive Urban Management Associates (PUMA), a Denver-based real estate economics and planning firm, conducted a market-based investment strategy for Downtown Greeley. To review the final study, click here.
