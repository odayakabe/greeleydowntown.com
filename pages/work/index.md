Now is the time to invest in Downtown Greeley! With job, investment and historic preservation credits, several grant programs, attractive loan rates, venture capital opportunities, and low lease rates, Downtown Greeley really is the place to be.

Downtown has traditionally been the heart of the community, and Downtown Greeley is no different. It is continually being rejuvenated and revitalized with the addition of new businesses, refaced storefronts, and other renovations. Plus, there is a historic charm that cannot be found anywhere else in the City.
